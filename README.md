# Project Background
Manufacturing Downtime

The company has significant amount of data on its manufacturing Productivity and Downtime that has been previously underutilized. 
This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes the data in order to uncover critical insight that will improve the bottling production line success.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Efficiency:** An evaluation on the current line of efficiency.
- **Operator Performance:** An assessment on operators performance, understanding their impact on production.  
- **Downtime Factor:** An assessment on the leading factor of downtime.
- **Operator Challenges:** An evaluation on operators struggle with particular types of operator's controllable error.

# Data Structure & Initial Checks
The CSV data file consist of multiple tables: Products, Line productivity, Line downtime, Downtime factors with a row count of 94 records.

Prior to begining the analysis, a variety of checks where conducted for quality control and familiarization with datasets. The raw data file can be found [here]()

# Executive Summary

### Overview Findings
Each operator performed efficiently and high above average. While there is no any underperformed operator, the production line efficency dropped low with **11%**.
There are downtime factors that can be attributed to the low line of efficiency, with Machine Adjustment **24%**, Machine Failure **18%**, Inventory Shortage **16%** respectively, as the leading factors.

The downtime factors can be classified as controllable and uncontrollable error factor by operator, where all the operators struggle significantly with one or more controllable error factor.
Like the Machine Adjustment **24%**, Batch Coding Error **10%** and Batch Change **12%**. The following section will explore other contributing factors and highlights key opportunity areas for improvement.

Below is the overview page from the PowerBI dashboard and more examples are included throughout the report. The entire interractive dashboard can be downloaded [here]()

##### Operator Performance:
- Operator **Mac** performed efficiently higher than other operators with 72% efficiency, while other operators performed at 60% average.
- Operator **Charles** worked more minutes than other operators record 1158 minutes.
- Operator **Charles** and **Dee**  worked more batches recording 11 batches each, while **Dennis** and **Mac** recorded total of 8 batches each,
